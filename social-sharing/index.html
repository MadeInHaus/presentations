# So what are our options?

- Minimal setup
- No permissions

# Thinking outside the box

On Netflix Binge, a unique url parameter was attached to the shared URL. When that URL was clicked, users were sent back to our app which read the parameter and triggered an overlay that contained the entire image.

# 2. Share Actual Media _(Images, Video)_

---

class: center, middle

### Pros
- Greater control over visual presentation
- Tighter integration with other native platform features

### Cons
- Larger dev effort
- Mandatory authentication and permissions
- Requires Facebook application approval
- Probably prevents users from ultimately sharing

# So what now? What's the best solution?

---

class: center, middle

# As always, the project should dictate the proper solution

Sharing has a tremendous impact on our *design*, *ux* and *architecture*

---

class: center, middle

# As a team, we need to be pro-active

---

class: center, middle

# Clients should be made aware of these sharing options up-front...

---

class: center, middle

# ...and we should design our applications with these varying flows in mind

---

class: center, middle

# In summary...

---

class: center, middle

# Don't be garbage
